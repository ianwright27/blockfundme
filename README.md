# BlockFundMe

## Description

**BlockFundMe** is a blockchain-powered decentralized application (dApp) that functions similarly to GoFundMe, but leverages Web3 technology. This platform enables users to contribute funds towards a shared goal, where only the contract owner can withdraw the raised funds. Non-owner users can participate by making funding calls to the contract, but the control over the withdrawal is trustlessly handled by the smart contract itself.

The **trustless nature** of the blockchain and the underlying smart contract ensures that the platform is immune to fraud, data manipulation, or interference by any centralized authority or third-party intermediary. This makes the entire process more secure and transparent, empowering individuals to fund causes directly without relying on intermediaries.

## Features

- **Decentralized Funding:** Anyone (except the contract owner) can make contributions to the contract's funding pool.
- **Owner-Only Withdrawals:** Only the contract owner has the permission to withdraw the funds once the goal is met.
- **Security & Transparency:** Blockchain and smart contract technologies ensure that funds are secure and that all transactions are recorded on-chain.

## Notes

This project will continue to evolve over time. I will be updating both the front-end and the underlying smart contract to introduce more features, enhancements, and security improvements. Keep an eye out for new functionality as the project grows.
